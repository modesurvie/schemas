To activate the whitelist, the white-list value in server.properties must be changed to true: 'white-list=true'. Then only the named users are allowed to connect to the server. As well as manually editing the file, the command /whitelist can also be used by operators.\nhttps://minecraft.wiki/w/Server#Whitelist\nhttps://minecraft.wiki/w/Commands/whitelist\nhttps://minecraft.wiki/w/Server.properties",
